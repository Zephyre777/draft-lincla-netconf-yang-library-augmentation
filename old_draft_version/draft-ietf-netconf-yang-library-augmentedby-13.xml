      <t> The YANG library <xref target="RFC8525" /> provides information about the data model
        supported by the server. This is presented as an inventory of YANG modules. It helps a
        client with listing all datastores supported by a network management server and the schema
        that is used by each of these datastores.</t>
      <t> According to Section 4.2.8 and 5.6.3 in <xref target="RFC7950" />, augment defines
        additional nodes to the module while deviations change (add, modify, delete) properties
        (sub-statements) to other module's schema nodes. They provide crucial information about the
        YANG data model composition, and is referred to as reverse dependency in this document: this
        means the behavior of a schema node depends on external modifications, creating flow
        backward from the augmenting/deviation module to the base module. </t>
      <t> Currently, it is difficult to obtain the YANG schema tree (defined in Section 3 in <xref
          target="RFC7950" />) without obtaining and parsing all the YANG modules from a management
        server. The deviation list defined in YANG library enables client to obtain the module
        reverse dependency without having to get and parse all YANG modules. However, the
        augmentation list is not defined in it. </t>
      <t>
        Since both augmentation and deviation work as YANG module dependencies,
        it is reasonable to document them the same way in the YANG library.
        Having both augmentation and deviation directly
        available in the YANG library provides an easy and light-weight
        solution for determining the reverse dependencies.
      </t>

      <t>Therefore, this document proposes a YANG module that augments the YANG library to include
        the YANG module augmentation information.</t>

      <t>One specific limitation with the implementation of this augmented-by YANG module
        specification is, the modules and the augmented-by modules require now to be listed in the
        same module-set. Note that a similar restriction already applies for the YANG deviations.</t>

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">

      <t>When using YANG modules, it is necessary to make sure that all its dependencies are
        present. <xref target="RFC7950" /> identifies four types of dependencies between YANG
        modules:</t>

      <t>
        <ul>
          <li>Import: the "import" statement allows a module or
            submodule to reference definitions defined in other modules.</li>

          <li>Include: the "include" statement is used in a module
            to identify each submodule that belongs to it.</li>

          <li>Augment: the augmentation defines the
            location in the data model hierarchy where additional
            nodes are inserted.</li>

          <li>Deviation: the "deviation" statement defines a
            fragment of a module that the server does not
            implement.</li>
        </ul>
      </t>
      <t>The import and include are direct dependencies which can be obtained by parsing the YANG
        module source code, while the augmentation and deviation are reverse dependencies which are
        defined in another module.
      </t>
      <t>
        For the reverse dependencies, since they are defined
        externally, it is not possible to discover them by parsing the YANG module.
        The current way to discover the reverse dependencies is to query
        all YANG modules from the server and parse them. This is a lengthy
        process, which must be repeated for each client that requires this
        information.
      </t>
      <t> According to the definition of the module ietf-yang-library defined in <xref
          target="RFC8525" />, the "deviation" list describes that a module is deviated by which
        other modules. Since deviations and augmentations work similarly, if the YANG library could
        directly report all reverse dependencies, including augmentations, it would provide a much
        easier and light-weight solution to find module all dependencies, compared to obtaining and
        parsing all modules. In addition, to avoid causing problems in devices, for instance,
        falsely referring to modules in the wrong module-set, this document requires that the base
        modules and the augmentations be listed in the same module-set. </t>
      <t>
        The YANG library only provides the deviation
        list, without augmentations. With augmentations
        being more widely used and defined, and with use cases to automate network management,
        augmentations become
        essential information for clients to better understand the network management server module
        relationships. Thus, the YANG library should be extended to also provide the augmentation
        information.
      </t>

    <section anchor="Use Cases" title="Use Cases">
      <section anchor="Data Mesh Architecture" title="Data Mesh Architecture">
        <t> As the demand for YANG-based telemetry <xref target="RFC8641" /> arises, there is a need
          for real-time knowledge of a specific YANG module's dependency list when a specific
          YANG-Push notification for a given subscription is received. </t>
        <t> Some YANG-Push receivers will collect the information in advance of the telemetry
          collection, storing the entire module set for every single server who could be streaming
          data. However, this approach is not always practical in case of Configured Subscriptions <xref
            target="RFC8639" /> where the YANG-Push receiver is not configuring the subscriptions
          itself and in case of UDP transport <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif" />. See
          figure 1 in An Architecture for YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration" /> for more details.</t>
        <t>
          This architecture relies on the information of YANG dependencies in this specification to
          solve the problem of missing YANG semantics when notifications are transformed or indexed
          in Time Series Database.</t>
        <t>
          Prior to the implementation of this specification, the method used for obtaining modules
          and finding module dependencies is to retrieve the full set of supported YANG modules from
          the network device, triggered by parsing the &lt;subscription-started&gt; message for each
          new YANG-Push subscription, because the YANG-push receiver would not know which YANG-Push
          publisher sends the subscribed YANG content until the first notification is received.</t>
        <t>
          By using the provided the augmentedby information in this specification, the YANG-Push
          receiver can directly obtain the YANG reverse dependencies for the specific YANG module(s)
          in the subscription by querying the server, saving collection and processing time at the
          YANG-Push receiver, by querying dependencies only for the required modules, and therefore
          helping with the real-time aspects of network observability.</t>
        <t>
          Following is an example YANG-Push message of this use case received from within a
          subscription to YANG module ietf-interfaces:
        </t>

        <t>
          To correctly interpret the semantics of this message, both the ietf-interfaces and ietf-ip
          YANG modules are required. Knowing only that the subscribed YANG module is ietf-interfaces
          is therefore insufficient, but that is currently the only dependency information exposed
          by the subscription information. In this case, a lightweight mechanism is needed to
          discover all relevant dependency modules, especially reverse dependencies (refer to
          ietf-ip in this example) so that every YANG module referenced in the pushed data can be
          reliably identified.

      <section anchor="Data Catalog" title="Data Catalog">

        <t>Finding the YANG modules implemented by a network management server is paramount for
          configuring and monitoring the status of a network. However, since the inception of YANG
          the network industry has experienced a tsunami of YANG modules developed by SDOs,
          open-source communities, and network vendors. This heterogeneity of YANG modules, that
          vary from one network device model to another, makes the management of a multi-vendor
          network a big challenge for operators. <xref target="Martinez-Casanueva2023"></xref></t>

        <t>In this regard, a data catalog provides a registry of the datasets
          exposed by remote data sources for consumers to discover data
          of interest. Besides the location of the dataset
          (i.e., the data source), the data catalog registers
          additional metadata such as the data model (or schema) followed in the
          dataset or even related terms defined in a business glossary.</t>

        <t>Data catalog solutions typically implement collectors that
          ingest metadata from the data sources themselves and external
          metadata sources. For example, a Kafka Schema Registry is a
          metadata source that provides metadata about the data models
          followed by some data stored in a Kafka topic.</t>

        <t>In this sense, a YANG-enabled network device can be considered
          as another kind of data source, which the Data Catalog can
          pull metadata from. For instance, the data catalog can include a
          connector that fetches metadata about the YANG modules implemented
          by the network device. Combining this metadata with other such as
          the business concept "interface", would enable data consumers to
          discover which datasets related to the concept "interface"
          are exposed by the network device.</t>

        <t>Network devices that implement YANG library expose metadata
          about which YANG modules are implemented, and which are only imported.
          However, what a data consumer needs at the end are the YANG modules
          implemented by the device, hence, the combination of implemented YANG
          modules with other YANG modules that might deviate or augment the formers.</t>

        <t>Coming back to the example of datasets related to the "interface" concept, say we have a
          network device that implements the ietf-interfaces module <xref target="RFC8343" /> and
          the ietf-ip module <xref target="RFC8344" />, where the latter augments the former. For a
          data catalog to collect this metadata, a connector would retrieve YANG library data from
          the target device. However, the current version of YANG library would not satisfy the use
          case as it would tell that the device implements both ietf-interfaces and ietf-ip modules,
          but will miss the augment dependency between them.</t>

        <t>The current workaround is in combination with the
          YANG library data to additionally obtain both YANG modules and process them
          to discover that there is an augment dependency. This adds extra burden
          on the connector, which is forced to combine multiple metadata collection
          mechanisms. This process could be softened by extending YANG library
          to also capture augment dependencies, similarly to
          deviation dependencies.</t>

        This YANG module augments the ietf-yang-library module by adding the
        augmented-by leaf-list in the "yang-library/module-set" and "yang-library/modules-state".
        The name of list "augmented-by" indicates by which modules that the current module is being
        directly augmented.</t>
      <t> The "yang-library/module-state" is augmented despite its "deprecated" state to cope with
        the situation when container "modules-state" is used for compatibility reason with
        ietf-yang-library defined in <xref target="RFC7895" />. Both the NMDA<xref target="RFC8342" />
        and non-NMDA compliant additions are defined in the same YANG module for simplicity for
        users and implementors. </t>
      <t>For the scope of "augmented-by", this draft only considers the direct augmentation
        relationship. The recursive result of augmentation or transitive dependency for module

          <t>This section explains the scope of augmented-by.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "augmented-by" leaf-list should only consider those YANG modules that directly
            augment the YANG module in question in the ietf-yang-library, and the augmenting and
            augmented modules must be defined in the same module-set. </t>
          <t>The "direct augment" is identified by the relationship between the augment module and
            the target node's parent module that it augments to. Only the direct parent module of
            the target node is augmented, and the rest of the parent modules defined in the schema
            tree are only indirect dependencies but not augmented modules. (Refer to "Target node"
            definition in Section 7.17 of <xref target="RFC7950" />) </t>

          <t>In the case when a YANG application requires recursive dependency or specific schema
            tree dependency, the search logic should be implemented by the application itself.</t>

          <t>A YANG example with the expected augmented-by result is provided in Section 4.2.2.</t>

        <section anchor="exampleOfAugmentedBy" title="An example of YANG module augmented-by result">
          <t>This section provides a module-set to explain the definition of "direct augment" stated
            in Section 4.2.1.</t>
          <t>There are Modules A, B, C, which have the following relationships:</t>
          <t>
            <ul>
              <li>Module A is the base module with container "foo-a"</li>
              <li>Module B augments "/a:foo-a" with container "foo-b"</li>
              <li>Module C augments "/a:foo-a/b:foo-b" with leaf "leaf-c"</li>
            </ul>
          </t>
          <t>In this example, while the XPath that Module C augments to contains container "foo-a"
            defined in Module A, the actual target node it directly augments to is "foo-b" in Module
            B. Therefore, Module C is not an augmentation for Module A and does not appear in the
            "augmented-by" leaf-list of Module A. Only Module B, which is directly augmenting to
            "foo-a", is an "augmented-by" for Module A.</t>
          <t>The augmented-by XML result for Modules A, B and C is the following:</t>

    <section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

      <t> This section follows the guidelines in Section 3.7 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis" />. </t>

      <t> The "ietf-yang-library-augmentedby" YANG module defines a data model that is designed to
        be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241" />
        and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040" />. These YANG-based management protocols require the
        use of a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH <xref target="RFC4252" />, TLS <xref
          target="RFC8446" />, and QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" />) and require mutual
        authentication. </t>

      <t> The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341" /> provides a
        means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset
        of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content. </t>
      <t>
        There are no writable ("config true") data nodes defined in this
        YANG module.
      </t>
      <t>
        This YANG module defines only readable ("config false") data nodes.
        Some of these readable data nodes may be considered sensitive or
        vulnerable in some network environments. It is important to control
        read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to these
        data nodes.
      </t>

      <t>
        Specifically, the following readable data nodes contain potentially
        sensitive information:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            <tt>/yang-library/module-set/module/augmented-by</tt>
          </t>
          <t>
            <tt>/modules-state/module/augmented-by</tt> (modules-state is deprecated) </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        These nodes expose the augmentation relationships among modules
        implemented by a server. Unauthorized read access could help an
        attacker identify implementation structure, optional features, or
        software components present on a server, which might then be used to
        target known platform vulnerabilities. Therefore, access control
        policies SHOULD restrict read access to authorized users only.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are no RPCs or action operations defined in this module.
        Therefore, there are no particularly sensitive RPC or action
        operations.
      </t>
      <t> This module uses groupings from the YANG Library defined in <xref target="RFC8525" />. The
        reusable groupings originate from a module that contains readable schema information.
        Readers should refer to the Security Considerations section of <xref target="RFC8525" /> for
        additional information about the sensitivity of schema-related information. </t>
      <t>
        Other than the considerations described above, this module does not
        introduce additional security risks beyond those described in the
        referenced RFCs.

      <t>This section gives an example of the yang-library content that the user can
        try themselves with yanglint. This is created to demonstrate and validate
        the correct syntax. The example should be compiled with YANG modules
        ietf-yang-library and ietf-yang-library-augmentedby as schemas.</t>
      <t>The examples provided are ietf-yang-library 'yang-library' data XML
        file containing the augmented-by field.

        title="An ietf-yang-library yang-library data XML example">
        <t>The yang-library XML example concerns the following module-set:</t>
        <t>There are module1, module2, module3, which have the following relationships:</t>
        <t>
          <ul>
            <li>Module 1 is the base module with container "foo1"</li>
            <li>Module 2 augments "/module1:foo1" with container "foo2"</li>
            <li>Module 3 augments "/module1:foo1" with leaf "leaf3"</li>
          </ul>
        </t>
        <t>All three YANG modules are defined in the same module-set name 'ms1' to be able to
          augment or be augmented by the others. Otherwise, the yanglint validation should fail.</t>
