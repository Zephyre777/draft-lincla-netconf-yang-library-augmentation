  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

    <t>
      The YANG library <xref target="RFC8525" /> provides information about the data model supported by the server. This is presented as an inventory of YANG modules. It helps a client with listing all datastores supported by a network management server and the schema that is used by each of these datastores.</t>
    <t>
    According to Section 4.2.8 and 5.6.3 in <xref target="RFC7950" />, augment defines additional nodes to the module while deviations change (add, modify, delete) properties (sub-statements) to other module's schema nodes. They provide crucial information about the YANG data model composition, and is referred to as reverse dependency in this document: this means the behavior of a schema node depends on external modifications, creating flow backward from the augmenting/deviation module to the base module. </t>
    <t>
    Currently it is difficult to obtain the YANG schema tree <xref target="RFC8340"/> without obtaining and parsing all the YANG modules from a management server. The deviation list defined in YANG library 
    enables client to obtain the module reverse dependency without having to 
    get and parse all YANG modules. However, the augmentation list is not defined in it.
    </t><t>
    Since both augmentation and deviation work as YANG module dependencies, 
    it is reasonable to document them the same way in the YANG library. 
    Having both augmentation and deviation directly 
    available in the YANG library provides an easy and light-weight 
    solution for determining the reverse dependencies.
    </t>

    <t>Therefore, this document proposes a YANG module that augments the YANG library to include the YANG module augmentation information.</t>

    <section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">

    <t>When using YANG modules, it is necessary to make sure
    that all its dependencies are presented. <xref target="RFC7950" />
    identifies four types of dependencies between YANG modules:</t>

    <t>
    <ul>
      <li>Import: the "import" statement allows a module or
      submodule to reference definitions defined in other modules.</li>

      <li>Include: the "include" statement is used in a module
      to identify each submodule that belongs to it.</li>

      <li>Augmentation: the "augment" statement defines the
      location in the data model hierarchy where additional
      nodes are inserted.</li>

      <li>Deviation: the "deviation" statement defines a
      fragment of a module that the server does not
      implement.</li>
    </ul>
    </t>
    <t>The import and include are direct dependencies which can be obtained by parsing the YANG module source code, while the augmentation and deviation are reverse dependencies which are defined in another module.
    </t>
    <t>
      For the reverse dependencies, since they are defined
      externally, it is not possible to discover them by parsing the YANG module.
      The current way to discover the reverse dependencies is to query 
      all YANG modules from the server and parse them. This is a lengthy 
      process, which must be repeated for each client that requires this 
      information.
    </t>
    <t>
      According to the definition of the module ietf-yang-library defined in 
      <xref target="RFC8525"/>, the "deviation" list describes that a module is deviated by which other modules. If the YANG library could directly report all reverse dependencies, 
      it would provide a much easier and light-weight solution to find module 
      all dependencies, compared to obtaining and parsing all modules.
    </t>
    <t>
      The YANG library only provides the deviation 
      list, without augmentations. With augmentations 
      being more widely used and defined, and with use cases to automate network management, augmentations become 
      essential information for clients to better understand the network management server module 
      relationships. Thus, the YANG library should be extended to also provide the augmentation information.
    </t>
    <t>
      From the perspective of the operational efficiency, it is easy to adapt the device implementation to include augmentation, since augmentation and deviation work similarly. 
    </t>
  </section>

  <section anchor="Use Cases" title="Use Cases">
  <t>
  As the demand for
  YANG-based telemetry <xref target="RFC8641"/> arises, there is
  a need for real-time knowledge of a specific YANG module's
  dependency list when a specific YANG-Push notification for a given subscription is
  received. </t>
  <t>The alternative for a YANG-Push receiver is to
  collect and store the entire module set for every single
  server who could be streaming data. This approach is not
  always practical due to the following reasons:
  </t>
  <t>
    <ul>
      <li>For a YANG-Push receiver =&gt; from which YANG-Push publisher
     the subscribed YANG content is going to be received is not known until the first notification is being received.</li>
      <li>Querying all the YANG modules is time-consuming and overhead considering that only a subset of YANG nodes of the management server are subscribed.</li>
    </ul>
  </t>
  <t>This section introduces two use cases that reflect the motivation
  for extending the YANG library. One targets solving dependency problems in
  a data mesh architecture while the other aims at building a
  data catalog that makes YANG module information easily accessible.
  </t>
    <section anchor="Data Mesh Architecture" title="Data Mesh Architecture">
      <t>
      A network analytics architecture that integrates YANG-Push and
      Kafka is introduced in draft:
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration">An
      Architecture for YANG-Push to Apache Kafka Integration</xref>.
      This open-source project encompasses contributions such as
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-notifications-versioning">
      Support of Versioning in YANG Notifications Subscription</xref> or
      <xref target="I-D.netana-netconf-notif-envelope">
      Support of Network Observation Timestamping in YANG Notifications
      </xref>, among others. </t>

      <t>The purpose of this project is to provide adequate
      information to the YANG-Push notifications so that the module and its dependencies can be parsed and retrieved automatically from the vantage point. The architecture relies on
      the information of YANG dependencies to realize, to solve the problem of missing YANG
      semantics when notifications are transformed or indexed in Time Series Database.
      As a solution to provide the missing YANG semantics, a schema registry is introduced to store YANG modules and all their relationships (Direct and reverse dependencies). The schema is obtained by NETCONF &lt;get-schema&gt; operation (defined in Section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC6022"/>) of the subscribed YANG schema tree, which is obtained by parsing the &lt;subscription-started&gt; message of each YANG-Push subscription.
      </t>
      <t>When obtaining the dependency modules of a YANG module, an independent 
      process containing multiple &lt;get-schema&gt; operations <xref target="RFC6022"/> is launched
      after each new YANG-Push subscription module has been known. 
      However, the complexity remains at:
      </t>
      <t>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How dependencies of YANG modules are found (so that
            the YANG-Push subscription message has the complete set of module
            dependencies for its subscribed YANG schema tree)?
          </li>
          <li>
          How do we conduct &lt;get-schema&gt;? 
          </li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>Currently, the method used for obtaining modules and finding module 
      dependencies is getting the full set of supported YANG modules from the network device.  This process is very heavy because in practice, each device may implement hundreds of YANG modules, requiring up to
      several minutes to complete the YANG modules retrieval. Besides, the need
      for parsing all YANG modules and finding all the dependencies adds an
      extra delay. Obtaining all dependencies through this method makes the operation very costly, since after each subscribed module is learned, the operation of getting the full set of modules needs to be performed again. 
      </t>
      <t>
      Therefore, considering the Network Observability real-time aspects, this extra
      delay in collecting (and processing) the dependencies through the approach of getting the full set of modules is not realistic.
      </t>
      <t>It's more efficient to get dependencies only for the required modules.
      </t>
      <t>
      By using the provided the augmentation information in ietf-yang-library, 
      the YANG-Push receiver can directly obtain the YANG reverse dependencies 
      by obtaining the contents of the YANG library, saving
      collection (and processing time) at the YANG-Push receiver and therefore
      helping with the real-time aspects of Network Observability and enabling closed-loop actions.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="Data Catalog" title="Data Catalog">

      <t>Finding the YANG modules implemented by a network management server is paramount for
      configuring and monitoring the status of a network. However, since the
      inception of YANG the network industry has experienced a tsunami of
      YANG modules developed by SDOs, open-source communities,
      and network vendors. This heterogeneity of YANG modules, that vary
      from one network device model to another, makes the management of a
      multi-vendor network a big challenge
      for operators. <xref target="Martinez-Casanueva2023"></xref></t>

      <t>In this regard, a data catalog provides a registry of the datasets
      exposed by remote data sources for consumers to discover data
      of interest. Besides the location of the dataset
      (i.e., the data source), the data catalog registers
      additional metadata such as the data model (or schema) followed in the
      dataset or even related terms defined in a business glossary.</t>

      <t>Data catalog solutions typically implement collectors that
      ingest metadata from the data sources themselves and external
      metadata sources. For example, a Kafka Schema Registry is a
      metadata source that provides metadata about the data models
      followed by some data stored in a Kafka topic.</t>

      <t>In this sense, a YANG-enabled network device can be considered
      as another kind of data source, which the Data Catalog can
      pull metadata from. For instance, the data catalog can include a
      connector that fetches metadata about the YANG modules implemented
      by the network device. Combining these metadata with other such as
      the business concept "interface", would enable data consumers to
      discover which datasets related to the concept "interface"
      are exposed by the network device.</t>

      <t>Network devices that implement YANG library expose metadata
      about which YANG modules are implemented, and which are only imported.
      However, what a data consumer needs at the end are the YANG modules
      implemented by the device, hence, the combination of implemented YANG
      modules with other YANG modules that might deviate or augment the formers.</t>

      <t>Coming back to the example of datasets related to the "interface"
      concept, say we have a network device that implements the
      ietf-interfaces module <xref target="RFC8343" />
      and the ietf-ip module <xref target="RFC8344" />,
      where the latter augments the former. For a data catalog to
      collect these metadata, a connector would retrieve YANG library
      data from the target device. However, the current version
      of YANG library would not satisfy the use case as it would
      tell that the device implements both ietf-interfaces and ietf-ip
      modules, but will miss the augment dependency between them.</t>

      <t>The current workaround is in combination with the
      YANG library data to additionally obtain both YANG modules and process them
      to discover that there is an augment dependency. This adds extra burden
      on the connector, which is forced to combine multiple metadata collection
      mechanisms. This process could be softened by extending YANG library
      to also capture augment dependencies, in a similar fashion to
      deviation dependencies.</t>

      This YANG module augments the ietf-yang-library module by adding the
      augmented-by leaf-list in the "yang-library/module-set" and "yang-library/modules-state". The "yang-library/module-state" is augmented despite its "deprecated" state to cope with the situation when container "modules-state" is used for compatibility reason with ietf-yang-library defined in <xref target="RFC7895"/>. The name of list "augmented-by" indicates by which modules that the current module is being directly augmented. 
      </t>
      <t>For the scope of "augmented-by", this draft only considers the direct augmentation relationship. The recursive result of augmentation or transitive dependency for module specified along the xpath, is out of the scope of this draft. Section 4.2 has given the implementation instructions.</t>

      <t>
        The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for 
        data that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols 
        such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF 
        <xref target="RFC8040"/>. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure 
        transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is 
        Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer 
        is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is 
        TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) 
        <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to restrict access for 
        particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of 
        all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
      </t>
      <t>
        The readable node defined in this YANG module may be considered 
        sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus 
        important to control read access(e.g., via get, get-config, or 
        notification) to this data node. The following is the explanation of
        data node's sensitivity/vulnerability:
      </t>
      <t>
        The "augmented-by" list in this YANG module could reveal all modules 
        that are augmenting one module. It could help attacker identify 
        the relationship between modules and server implementations known bugs.
        Server vulnerabilities may include but not restricted to: 1. Too many
        augmented-by records cause buffer overflow. 2. The augmented-by list
        helps identify through the inter-relation of modules how to cause the
        server to crash or significantly degrade device performance.

    <section anchor="YANG module validation with yanglint" title="YANG module validation with yanglint">
      <t>This section gives an example of the yang-library content that the user can
      try themselves with yanglint. This is created to demonstrate and validate
      the correct syntax. The example should be compiled with YANG modules
      ietf-yang-library and ietf-yang-library-augmentedby as schemas.</t>
      <t>The examples provided are ietf-yang-library 'yang-library' data xml 
      file containing the augmented-by field. 
      </t>
      <section anchor="A valid ietf-yang-library data example" title="An ietf-yang-library yang-library data xml example">
        <t>The yang-library xml example concerns the following module-set:</t>
        <t>There are module1, module2, module3, which have the following relationships:</t>
        <t>
          <ul>
            <li>Module 1 is the base module with container "foo1"</li>
            <li>Module 2 augments "/module1:foo1" with container "foo2"</li>
            <li>Module 3 augments "/module1:foo1" with leaf "leaf3"</li>
          </ul>
        </t>
        <t>All three YANG modules are defined in the same module-set name 'ms1' to be able to augment or be augmented by the others. Otherwise, the yanglint validation should fail.</t>
        <t>The example is following:</t>
